# Utilization-of-Citrus-Enzyme-in-concrete-as-an-Admixture

The quality of the concrete is determined by the materials of concrete preparation. In order to make
concrete with high compression strength and has a certain concrete specification cannot be obtained
simply by mixing Portland cement or other types of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and water. But it is
necessary to also control the quality of the concrete mix. Improving the quality of the concrete mix will
increase the compression strength is generated.

Mixed concrete technology is currently also developing rapidly, many other added material application
technologies to produce concrete with the desired characteristics. One way to improve the quality of the
concrete mix is to use the added material, either a chemical such as entraining admixture, reducing water
in the form of synthetic or organic. On this paper, we would like to introduce our research on improving
concrete quality with green technology using bio enzyme, which is not covered yet in current
classification A to F of concrete chemical admixtures used
